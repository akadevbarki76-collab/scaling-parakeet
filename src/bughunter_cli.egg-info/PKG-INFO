### About The Project

This project was born from the need for a more efficient, integrated, and intelligent approach to bug bounty hunting and penetration testing. Instead of juggling multiple tools and manually correlating results, BugHunter-CLI provides a single, powerful interface to orchestrate scans, manage findings, and uncover vulnerabilities.

By integrating with Google's Gemini AI, the CLI can offer intelligent suggestions, generate dynamic scan configurations, and help you understand complex vulnerabilities, making it a powerful learning tool as well.

### Key Features

*   **ü§ñ AI-Powered Analysis**: Utilizes Gemini AI (`src/plugins/gemini_ai.py`) for intelligent prompt engineering and analysis.
*   **üîß Integrated Toolchain**: Comes packed with industry-standard tools like `nmap`, `nikto`, `nuclei`, `sqlmap`, `dirsearch`, and more (`src/tools/`).
*   **‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Engine**: Create and run complex, multi-step security testing workflows (`src/workflow_engine.py`).
*   **üéÆ Gamification**: Earn points and track your progress with a built-in gamification system (`src/gamification.py`).
*   **üîå Extensible Plugins**: Easily add new tools and functionality through a simple plugin architecture (`src/plugins/`).
*   **üìú Rich Documentation**: Comprehensive guides available in the [Wiki](wiki/Home.md).

### Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

#### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.10+
*   `git`

#### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/barki/bughunter-cli.git
    cd bughunter-cli
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    The project includes a helper script to install all necessary components.
    ```sh
    ./install_dependencies.sh
    ```
3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

### Usage

Execute a basic web application scan using the interactive UI:

```sh
python src/main.py --target example.com
```

To run a specific tool directly:

```sh
python src/main.py --tool nmap --target scanme.nmap.org --args "-sV -p 22,80,443"
```

For more detailed instructions and commands, please refer to the [Command Reference](wiki/Command-Reference.md).
