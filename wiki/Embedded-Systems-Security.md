# Guide: Embedded Systems Security

This guide provides best practices and examples for using `bughunter-cli` to secure your embedded systems.

## Philosophy

Embedded systems present a unique set of security challenges. They often involve low-level programming in C/C++, direct memory manipulation, and interaction with hardware. `bughunter-cli` provides specialized tools to help you navigate this complex landscape and build more secure and reliable embedded devices.

## Core Workflow

A typical embedded systems security workflow with `bughunter-cli` looks like this:

1.  **Static Analysis of C/C++ Code:** The foundation of embedded security is writing safe and robust code. Use the `scan c-cpp` command to find common pitfalls in your C/C++ code.
    ```bash
    bughunter scan c-cpp /path/to/your/source
    ```

2.  **Scan for General Vulnerabilities:** Use the `scan code` command with the `--autocorrect` flag to find and fix a broader range of vulnerabilities with AI-powered assistance.
    ```bash
    bughunter scan code /path/to/your/source --autocorrect
    ```

3.  **Analyze Dependencies:** Embedded projects often rely on third-party libraries and real-time operating systems (RTOS). Scan these dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    ```bash
    bughunter scan dependencies /path/to/your/project
    ```

4.  **Firmware Analysis (Future):** Once implemented, the `scan firmware` command will be a critical step to analyze the final firmware image for hardcoded secrets and other vulnerabilities.

## Example: Securing a FreeRTOS Project

Let's say you are working on a project that uses FreeRTOS and a set of custom C drivers.

1.  **Scan your drivers for memory safety issues:**
    ```bash
    bughunter scan c-cpp ./drivers/
    ```
    This will use `cppcheck` to look for issues like buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, and resource leaks.

2.  **Scan the entire project with AI-powered autocorrection:**
    ```bash
    bughunter scan code . --autocorrect
    ```
    This will use Semgrep and the LLM to find and fix a wider range of potential vulnerabilities.

3.  **Check the FreeRTOS source and other dependencies for known CVEs:**
    ```bash
    bughunter scan dependencies .
    ```

## Best Practices

*   **Enable All Compiler Warnings:** Your compiler is your first line of defense. Always compile your code with the highest warning levels (e.g., `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic` for GCC/Clang).
*   **Use Static Analysis Early and Often:** Integrate `bughunter-cli` into your development workflow from the very beginning. Don't wait until the end of the project to start thinking about security.
*   **Defense in Depth:** Employ multiple layers of security. Use static analysis, dynamic analysis (when possible), and secure coding practices to build a robust system.
*   **Understand Your Hardware:** Be aware of the security features and limitations of your target hardware.
