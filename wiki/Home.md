# Welcome to the `bughunter-cli` Wiki

This is the central knowledge base for `bughunter-cli`, a project by **MUSTAPHA BARKI ENGINEERING AI AUTOMATICA EMBED SYS**.

## Our Philosophy

We believe that the future of software development and security is intelligent, automated, and accessible to all. `bughunter-cli` is the embodiment of this philosophy. It is more than just a tool; it is a platform built on three core pillars:

1.  **AI-Native Automation:** We leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to move beyond simple pattern matching and into the realm of intelligent, context-aware security analysis and automated code correction.
2.  **Specialized Engineering Focus:** We are dedicated to providing best-in-class support for the unique challenges of **Web Engineering** and **Embedded Systems**. Our tools are tailored to the specific needs of these critical domains.
3.  **Community-Driven Development:** We are committed to building a diverse and inclusive community where engineers from all backgrounds can learn, contribute, and thrive.

This wiki will serve as your guide to mastering `bughunter-cli` and joining us on our mission to build a more secure future.
